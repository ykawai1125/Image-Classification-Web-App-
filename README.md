# Image Classification Web App

This project is a deep learning-based web application built with Python, Flask, and PyTorch.  
It allows users to upload images and get predictions using a pre-trained ResNet model.

## Features
- Upload images through a simple web interface  
- Classify images using a ResNet deep learning model  
- REST API for programmatic access to predictions  
- Handles file uploads securely  
- Clean front-end using HTML & CSS

## Tech Stack
- Python – Core programming language  
- Flask – Lightweight web framework  
- PyTorch – For deep learning and model inference  
- HTML/CSS – Front-end interface  
- REST API – For HTTP-based prediction requests

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Deep learning & transfer learning with ResNet  
- Model loading and inference with PyTorch  
- RESTful API design with Flask  
- File handling and server-side validation  
- Front-end integration with HTML/CSS  
- HTTP request handling and response formatting
